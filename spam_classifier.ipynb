    "The first training run showed clear overfitting. Training accuracy kept climbing to 98% while validation accuracy plateaued around 93%. More telling was the validation loss - it dropped to ~0.17 around epoch 13, then started rising again while training loss kept decreasing. Classic overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I tried:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Smaller model (32-16 -> 16-8 neurons):** Helped a bit - the overfitting was less aggressive, but still there. Validation loss still crept up after epoch 17.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **L2 regularization:** Added weight penalties to discourage the model from relying too heavily on specific features. Didn't really improve things, and the overall validation loss was actually slightly worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Early stopping:** Instead of trying to prevent the model from overfitting, just stop training when it starts. Monitor validation loss, and if it doesn't improve for 5 epochs, stop and keep the best weights. Simple and effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The takeaway:** The model without any tricks achieved its best validation performance around epoch 12-15. All the regularization attempts were just trying to prevent training past that point. Early stopping does this directly without needing to tune regularization strength or layer sizes."
